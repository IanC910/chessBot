Board::getLegalMoves() needs to account for king of own colour being checked (legal moves consist only of moves that get king out of check)

How to get legal moves of a bishop?
    If pinned, only find moves on that pin line
    else find moves in all diagonal directions
    If king is checked initially, how to only find moves that get the king out of check?
        Moves to get the king out of check either take the checking piece or block the checking piece
        No moves for pieces except the king if it is double checked
